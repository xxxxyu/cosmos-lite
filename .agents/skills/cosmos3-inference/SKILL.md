description: >
  Guide users through running Cosmos3 inference — offline batch generation, online
  serving with Ray and Gradio, parallelism options, input formats, sampling parameters,
  and prompt upsampling. Use when the user asks "how do I run inference",
  "how do I generate a video", "how do I serve the model", "what parameters should I use",
  or any question about running the model to produce outputs.

# Cosmos3 Inference

## When to use this skill

- Use when a user wants to generate images or videos with Cosmos3
- Use when a user asks about inference parameters, input formats, or parallelism
- Use when a user wants to set up online serving (Ray Serve, Gradio)
- Use when a user asks about prompt engineering or upsampling
- For environment or import errors, hand off to **cosmos3-env-troubleshoot**

## Path convention

All paths below are relative to the cosmos3 package root (`../../../` from this skill file). All `uv run` / `python` commands should also be run from there.

## Things not obvious from the docs

- **Path resolution**: relative paths in input JSON files are resolved relative to the **JSON file's directory**, not the working directory.
- **Seed**: always pass `--seed` for reproducible results. Without it, a random seed is used each time.
- **Resume**: interrupted runs can be resumed by re-running the same command — existing outputs are skipped automatically.
- **`--keep-going`**: continues processing remaining samples after a per-sample failure (e.g. guardrail rejection). Used in online serving by default.
- **Unique names**: every sample in a run must have a unique `name` field, or the script will error.
