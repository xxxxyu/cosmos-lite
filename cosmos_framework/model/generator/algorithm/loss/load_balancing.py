    Compute the load balancing loss. We compute the load balancing loss
    for each layer, and then average the loss across all layers.

    For computing the load balancing loss for each layer, we can either
    use the fraction of tokens routed to each expert for this rank ("local" method), or
    use the fraction of tokens routed to each expert across all ranks ("global" method).

    Args:
        lbl_metadata: The load balancing metadata. Contains the following tensors
            - num_tokens_per_expert: [num_layers, num_experts] - The number of
              tokens routed to each expert for this rank for each layer.
            - num_tokens: [num_layers, 1] - The total number of tokens in the
              batch for each layer.
            - mean_router_prob_per_expert: [num_layers, num_experts] - The average
              probability of routing to each expert for this rank for each layer.
        coeff: The coefficient for the load balancing loss.
        method: The method for the load balancing loss. Can be "local" or "global".
        device_mesh: The device mesh. Only needed if method is "global".

        The load balancing loss. None if lbl_metadata is None or coeff is None.
