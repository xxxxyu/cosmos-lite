MoE Specialization Callback
============================
Monitors whether MoE experts are developing distinct, stable roles over training.
A well-trained MoE should have experts that specialize — each processing a different
kind of input — rather than a few generalist experts doing everything while the rest
idle.

  Expert Co-activation Rate
  -------------------------
  If two experts frequently fire together on the same token (both in the top-K
  selected), they are likely learning redundant representations. Ideally experts
  specialize on non-overlapping token types, so co-activation should stay close
  to the chance baseline of K/N (e.g. 8/128 ≈ 0.0625 for the 235B model).

  For each layer and each unique expert pair (i, j), we compute:
      CoAct(i, j) = N_{i,j} / N_i
  where N_{i,j} = number of tokens where both i and j were selected, and N_i =
  total tokens routed to expert i. We then summarize across all pairs as max and
  mean. A rising mean_coact, especially well above the chance baseline, signals
  that the router is collapsing onto a small correlated cluster of experts.

Buffer ownership
----------------
  coactivation_counts is reset here (in compute_moe_coactivation_metrics).
  Per-expert token counts are derived from coactivation_counts itself
  (row_sum + col_sum) / (K-1), so this callback is fully independent of
  ExpertHeatmap's reset cycle for total_tokens_per_expert.

    Compute per-layer Expert Co-activation metrics for both towers.

    For each unique expert pair (i < j) in the upper triangle of the N×N
    coactivation matrix, computes:
        CoAct(i, j) = N_{i,j} / N_i
    where N_{i,j} is the count of tokens where both i and j were in the top-K,
    and N_i is the total token count for expert i (the row expert, i.e. the
    lower-indexed expert in the pair).

    N_i is derived directly from the co-activation matrix rather than from
    the shared total_tokens_per_expert buffer, so this metric is independent
    of ExpertHeatmap's reset cycle.  Each token routed to expert i contributes
    to (K-1) co-activation pairs, so N_i = (row_sum_i + col_sum_i) / (K-1).

    High co-activation relative to the chance baseline (K/N) indicates that
    certain expert pairs are systematically selected together — a sign of
    redundancy rather than specialization.
