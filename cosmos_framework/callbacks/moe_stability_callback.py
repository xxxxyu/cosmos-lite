MoE Stability Callback
======================
Monitors whether the MoE router is staying healthy over the course of training.
A healthy router distributes tokens reasonably evenly, keeps all experts alive,
and remains uncertain enough (high entropy) that it is still learning to route.

Five metrics are tracked per layer, per tower (und / gen):

  Dead Expert Rate
  ----------------
  Fraction of experts receiving fewer than 10% of their fair-share of tokens
  (i.e. load fraction f_i < 0.1 / N). A dead expert has been effectively shut
  out by the router — it gets no gradient signal and its capacity is wasted.
  Ideal = 0. A rising dead-expert rate in the gen tower during early training
  is a common failure mode.

  Load Imbalance Factor (LIF)
  ---------------------------
  N * max(f_i), where f_i is the fraction of tokens routed to expert i.
  Measures how much the busiest expert is overloaded relative to uniform.
  LIF = 1.0 is perfect balance; <= 1.3 is healthy; > 3.0 indicates severe
  collapse onto a small set of experts. This is the same quantity watched by
  the load-balancing loss, but measured empirically rather than from the loss
  objective.

  Router Entropy (normalized)
  ---------------------------
  Mean per-token Shannon entropy of the full routing distribution, divided by
  log(N) to put it on a [0, 1] scale. H = 1 means the router is maximally
  uncertain (uniform over all experts); H = 0 means it always picks the same
  expert. Early in training entropy is high; we want it to stay reasonably
  high (> ~0.7) so the router continues to explore. A sudden drop signals
  routing collapse.

  Soft-vs-Hard Effective Experts (normalized)
  -------------------------------------------
  Soft and hard effective experts separate what the router *considers* (full
  probability distribution, before dispatch) from what top-k dispatch *actually
  uses* (empirical token-to-expert assignment, after dispatch). Both are
  expressed as a fraction of N, so they sit on the same axis as
  router_entropy_normalized. Their lower bounds differ slightly:
    soft_eff_normalized is bounded in [1/N, 1].
    hard_eff_normalized is bounded in [K/N, 1] — top-K dispatch always engages
      at least K experts in aggregate (the floor case is when every token
      picks the same K-expert subset).

      soft_eff_normalized = mean_t exp(H(p_t)) / N
        Average per-token router perplexity, divided by N. Asks: what fraction
        of experts is the router *considering* on a typical token? Computed
        as sum_per_token_soft_eff / total_tokens / N. Note: the unnormalized
        numerator is NOT exp of the mean entropy — by Jensen,
        mean_t exp(H_t) >= exp(mean_t H_t), and the gap matters when
        per-token entropies are heterogeneous.

      hard_eff_normalized = exp(H(f)) / N
        where f_i is the empirical fraction of *expert assignments* (not
        tokens) that went to expert i: f_i = tokens_per_expert_i / (T * K).
        Perplexity of the buffer-wide dispatch distribution, divided by N.
        Asks: what fraction of experts is top-k *actually* engaging across the
        buffer? A smoother sibling of LIF: where LIF watches the busiest
        expert, hard_eff watches the spread of the whole load distribution.

  Interpretation (high/low refer to values close to 1 vs close to 1/N):

      high soft_eff, high hard_eff
        Router considers many experts; top-k dispatch also uses many experts.
        Broadly healthy routing.
      low  soft_eff, low  hard_eff
        Router is confident or collapsed in probability space; dispatch is
        also concentrated. Entropy, LIF, and hard usage all agree that
        routing is narrow.
      high soft_eff, low  hard_eff
        Router distribution is broad, but top-k dispatch is concentrated —
        the "hidden top-k concentration" case where entropy can look healthy
        while LIF and co-activation are high.
      low  soft_eff, high hard_eff
        Less common: each token has a sharp router distribution, but
        different tokens choose different experts. Per-token confidence with
        buffer-wide diversity.

Buffer ownership
----------------
  This callback is fully self-contained: it reads and resets its own dedicated
  buffers (stability_tokens_per_expert, stability_total_tokens, sum_token_entropy,
  sum_per_token_soft_eff). It does not depend on ExpertHeatmap's reset cycle.

    Logs per-layer MoE stability metrics to W&B every N training steps.

    What it captures
    ----------------
    Whether the MoE router remains in a healthy, balanced state over training.
    The metrics collectively answer: are all experts still being used
    (dead_expert_rate), is load spread evenly (lif), is the router still
    making uncertain, exploratory decisions (router_entropy_normalized), and
    do the experts the router considers (soft_eff) match the experts top-k
    dispatch actually engages (hard_eff)?

    W&B layout
    ----------
    For each metric and each tower, two kinds of series are logged:
      - moe_stability/<metric>/<tower>/layer_NNN  — per model layer time series
      - moe_stability/<metric>/<tower>/mean|max   — summary across all MoE layers

    Metrics logged: dead_expert_rate, lif, router_entropy_normalized,
    soft_eff_normalized, hard_eff_normalized.

    Typical healthy ranges:
      dead_expert_rate  → 0 (any sustained non-zero value is a concern)
      lif               → <= 1.3 (alarm at > 3.0)
      router_entropy_normalized → > 0.7 (collapse if it drops sharply)
      soft_eff_normalized, hard_eff_normalized → high; a large gap between
